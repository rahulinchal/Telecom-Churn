# Conclusion
The telecommunications market is already well-established, and the rate of new customers is slow. As a result, companies in this industry prioritize retention and reducing customer churn. This project analyzed a churn dataset to identify the main factors contributing to churn and gain valuable insights. Through exploratory data analysis, we were able to gain insight into the churn dataset, listed below:

1. The four charge fields are directly related to the minute fields.
2. The area code may not be relevant and can be excluded.
3. Customers with the International Plan tend to churn more often.
4. Customers who have had four or more customer service calls churn significantly more than other customers.
5. Customers with high day and evening minute usage tend to churn at a higher rate.
6. There is no clear relationship between churn and the variables such as day calls, evening calls, night calls, international calls, night minutes, international minutes, account length, or voice mail messages.
