# Problem Statement
Telecom churn analysis is the process of identifying customers who are likely to cancel their service or switch to a different service provider. This is an important problem for telecom companies, as churn can have a significant impact on their revenue and profitability.

# Observation 
1. The service calls of customers varies from 0 to 9. <br>
2. Those customers who make more service calls they have a high probability of leaving. <br>
3. As we can see from graph , customers with more than 5, their churning rate is more. <br>
4. Hence customers who make more than 5 service calls, their queries should be solved immediately and they should be given better service so that they dont leave the company. <br>
5. Customers with four or more customer service calls churn more than four times as often as do the other customers. <br>

# Conclusion
The telecommunications market is already well-established, and the rate of new customers is slow. As a result, companies in this industry prioritize retention and reducing customer churn. This project analyzed a churn dataset to identify the main factors contributing to churn and gain valuable insights. Through exploratory data analysis, we were able to gain insight into the churn dataset, listed below:

1. The four charge fields are directly related to the minute fields.
2. The area code may not be relevant and can be excluded.
3. Customers with the International Plan tend to churn more often.
4. Customers who have had four or more customer service calls churn significantly more than other customers.
5. Customers with high day and evening minute usage tend to churn at a higher rate.
6. There is no clear relationship between churn and the variables such as day calls, evening calls, night calls, international calls, night minutes, international minutes, account length, or voice mail messages.
